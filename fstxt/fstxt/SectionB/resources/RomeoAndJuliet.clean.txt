self pursud my humour not pursuing his and gladly shunnd who gladly fled from me montague many a morning hath he there been seen with tears augmenting the fresh mornings dew adding to clouds more clouds with his deep sighs but all so soon as the allcheering sun should in the farthest east begin to draw the shady curtains from auroras bed away from light steals home my heavy son and private in

affections counsellor is to himselfi will not say how true but to himself so secret and so close so far from sounding and discovery as is the bud bit with an envious worm ere he can spread his sweet leaves to the air or dedicate his beauty to the sun could we but learn from whence his sorrows grow we would as willingly give cure as know enter romeo benvolio see where he comes so please you step

above a common bound romeo i am too sore enpierced with his shaft to soar with his light feathers and so bound i cannot bound a pitch above dull woe under loves heavy burden do i sink mercutio and to sink in it should you burden love too great oppression for a tender thing romeo is love a tender thing it is too rough too rude too boisterous and it pricks like thorn mercutio if love be rough with you be rough with love prick love for pricking and you beat love down give me a case to put my visage in putting on a mask a visor for a visor what care i what curious eye doth quote deformities here

well draw thee from the mire or save your reverence love wherein thou stickest up to the ears come we burn daylight ho romeo nay thats not so mercutio i mean sir in delay we waste our lights in vain light lights by day take our good meaning for our judgment sits five times in that ere once in our five wits romeo and we mean well in going to this mask but tis no wit to go mercutio why may one ask romeo i dreamt a dream tonight mercutio and so did i romeo well what was yours mercutio that dreamers often lie romeo in bed asleep while they do dream things true mercutio o then i see queen mab hath been with you she is the fairies midwife and she comes in shape no bigger than an agatestone on the forefinger of an alderman drawn with a team of little atomies over mens noses as they lie asleep her waggonspokes made of long spinners legs the cover of the wings of grasshoppers her traces of the smallest spiders web the collars of the moonshines watery beams her whip of crickets bone the lash of film her waggoner a small greycoated gnat not half so big as a round little worm prickd from the lazy finger of a maid her chariot is an empty hazelnut made by the joiner squirrel or old grub time out o mind the fairies coachmakers and in this state she gallops night by night through lovers brains and then they dream of love oer courtiers knees that dream on curtsies straight oer lawyers fingers who straight dream on fees oer ladies lips who straight on kisses dream which oft the angry mab with blisters plagues because their breaths with sweetmeats tainted are sometime she gallops oer a courtiers nose and then dreams he of smelling out a suit and sometime comes she with a tithepigs tail tickling a parsons nose as a lies asleep then dreams he of another benefice sometime she driveth oer a soldiers neck and then dreams he of cutting foreign throats of breaches ambuscados spanish blades of healths five fathom deep and then anon drums in his ear at which he starts and wakes and being thus frighted swears a prayer or two and sleeps again this is that very mab that plats the manes of horses in the night and bakes the elflocks in foul sluttish hairs which once untangled much misfortune bodes this is the hag when maids lie on their backs that presses them and learns them first to bear making them women of good carriage this is she romeo peace peace mercutio peace thou talkst of nothing mercutio true i talk of dreams which are the children of an idle brain begot of nothing but vain fantasy which is as thin of substance as the air and more inconstant than the wind who wooes even now the frozen bosom of the north and being angerd puffs away from thence turning his side to the dewdropping south benvolio this wind you talk of blows us from ourselves supper is done and we shall come too late romeo i fear too early for my mind misgives some consequence yet hanging in the stars shall bitterly begin his fearful date with this nights revels and expire the term of a despised life closd in my breast by some vile forfeit of untimely death but he that hath the steerage of my course direct my suit on lusty gentlemen benvolio strike drum exeunt scene v a hall in

the mouth of outrage for a while till we can clear these ambiguities and know their spring their head their true descent and then will i be general of your woes and lead you even to death meantime forbear and let mischance be slave to patience bring forth the parties of suspicion friar lawrence i am the greatest able to do least yet most suspected as the time and place doth make against me of this direful murder and here i stand both to impeach and purge myself condemned and myself excusd prince then say at once what thou dost know in this friar lawrence i will be brief for my short date of breath is not so long as is a tedious tale romeo there dead was husband to that juliet and she there dead that romeos faithful wife i married them and their stoln marriage day was tybalts doomsday whose untimely death banishd the newmade bridegroom from this city for whom and not for tybalt juliet pind you to remove that siege of grief from her betrothd and would have married her perforce to county paris then comes she to me and with wild looks bid me devise some means to rid her from this second marriage or in my cell there would she kill herself then gave i her so tutored by my art a sleeping potion which so took effect as i intended for it wrought on her the form of death meantime i writ to romeo that he should hither come as this dire night to help to take her from her borrowd grave being the time the potions force should cease but he which bore my letter friar john was stayd by accident and yesternight returnd my letter back then all alone at the prefixed hour of her waking came i to take her from her kindreds vault meaning to keep her closely at my cell till i conveniently could send to romeo but when i came some minute ere the time of her awaking here untimely lay the noble paris and true romeo dead she wakes and i entreated her come forth and bear this work of heaven with patience but then a noise did scare me from the tomb and she too desperate would not go with me but as it seems did violence on herself all this i know and to the marriage her nurse is privy and if ought in this miscarried by my fault let my old life be sacrificd some hour before his time unto the rigour of severest law prince we still have known thee for a holy man wheres romeos man what can he say to this balthasar i brought my master news of juliets death and then in post he came from mantua to this same place to this same monument this letter he early bid me give his father and threatend me with death going in the vault if i departed not and left him there prince give me the letter i will look on it where is the countys page that raisd the watch sirrah what made your master in this place page he came with flowers to strew his ladys grave and bid me stand aloof and so i did anon comes one with light to ope the tomb and by and by my master drew on him and then i ran away to call the watch prince this letter doth make good the friars words their course of love the tidings of her death and here he writes that he did buy a poison of a poor pothecary and therewithal came to this vault to die and lie with juliet where be these enemies capulet montague see what a scourge is laid upon your hate that heaven finds means to kill your joys with love and i for winking at your discords too have lost a brace of kinsmen all are punishd capulet o brother montague give me thy hand this is my daughters jointure for no more can i demand montague but i can give thee more for i will raise her statue in pure gold that whiles verona by that name is known there shall no figure at such rate be set as that of true and faithful juliet capulet as rich shall romeos by his ladys lie poor sacrifices of our enmity prince a glooming peace this morning with it brings the sun
